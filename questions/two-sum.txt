Skeleton:

def sumTwoLargest(lst):
    # write your solution code here

Test:
input = [5,3,4,7,10]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 17

Test:
input = [5,4,3,2,1]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 9

Test:
input = [3,7]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 10

Test:
input = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 2

Test:
input = [1,9,5,7,3]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 16
