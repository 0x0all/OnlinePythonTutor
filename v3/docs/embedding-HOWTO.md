# Embedding Online Python Tutor visualizations

This document is a starting point for anyone who wants to embed
Online Python Tutor (OPT) visualizations in their webpage. View it online at:

Look at the Git history to see when this document was last updated; the more time
elapsed since that date, the more likely things are out-of-date.

I'm assuming that you're competent in Python, JavaScript, command-line-fu, and Google-fu,
so I won't do much hand-holding in these directions.

This guide isn't meant to be comprehensive; you will undoubtedly still
be confused about details after reading it, so feel free to email
philip@pgbovine.net if you have questions.

And please excuse the sloppy writing; I'm not trying to win any style awards here :)
